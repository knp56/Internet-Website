# The Invention Of Internet

### The History of Internet ###
   The Internet was created for the Government to share information inside their own system in 1960. At this time, computer was a very gaint machine that only very few departments or schools owned one. Also, because of the Cold War with Soviet Union, US needed a way to transmitte messages even after the attach by unclear. Finally, they formed the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) which was the very first generation of Internet. Raymond Tomlinson was the one who created Email which was called a killing application after the invention of ARPANET and the sign @ was also created by him. In January 1, 1983 a protocol called Internetwork Protocol (IP) was established as a universe standard "computer lanuage" by Kahn and Cerf. This protocol allows various computers no different newwork to communicate with each other.    


### How does Internet Works ###
   Different people have different understanding of internet, and explained by the founder which is a result of another experiment called the ARPANET that helped with the communication problem. Who controls the internet? Answer is nobody or everybody. Internet ships binary information. 1 is on, 0 is off. How to transfer information? By electricity (to slow), by light (fiber, fast but too expensive), by radio (wireless, too short). May change in the future. Internet Protocols are important than how internet physically work. Information is assembled by varies packets and transferred by different routes

  
### Important Inventors ###
   In 1962, a scientist from M.I.T. and ARPA named J.C.R. Licklider proposed a solution to this problem: a “galactic network” of computers that could talk to one another. In 1965, another M.I.T. scientist developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called “packet switching.” In 1969, RPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” between UCLA and Standford. By the end of 1971, Vinton Cerf developed TCP(Transmission Control Protocol). In 1991, a computer programmer in Switzerland named Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not only simply a way to send files but also was itself a “web” of information that anyone on the Internet could retrieve.
